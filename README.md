Right now I can take 0 credit for the great work that jeromeetienne, id10t and many others have done. 
I forked this so I can see if a few ideas I have for augmented reality are doable in teh currnet state of technology. Of course I needed an SSL certificate and hositng area, so thank you to the wonderful people at github (and microsoft??)

# Experimentation with GPS for AR

This is an experimentation of using phone gps + gyroscope to display Augmented reality.

Note: GPS accuracy is significantly less than normal AR tracking. So be sure 
it matches your use-case.

Note2: this is very experimental and not finished.
